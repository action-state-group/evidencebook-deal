# Terms Pack Studio replay fixture

`sticker-trades.json` (`studio-sticker-trades/v0`) is ten past fox-sticker trades for the Terms
Pack Studio first demo (evidencebook-deal#136). `scripts/studio-replay.sh FIXTURE SELLER_HOME
BUYER_HOME` replays them through `capsulectl` and the deal plugin into a seller's and a buyer's
deal store; `scripts/check-studio-replay.sh` replays into fresh stores and checks the result.

Nine trades are clean. Trade 7 is the seller raising the price (150 to 175 minor USD) after the
buyer accepted the offer; the buyer pays 175.

## What a store holds

Each trade is a sale (`sale-…`, one item, closed with its completed thread) with one buyer thread
(`deal-…`). The buyer's store holds the other half of the same deal under the **same `deal-…` id**.
Ten closed `deal` entries per store (`deal list --json`, `kind: "deal"`); the seller's also holds ten
closed `sale` entries.

Read a deal's sealed records with `capsulectl --profile deal deal export --deal ID --output FILE`
(a JSON array in order, no raw values). Each record has `at` (the replay's own sealed time: the
CLI cannot backdate, so a whole replay spans a minute or two) and `type`/`body`.

## Seller's records for a clean trade (in order)

| `type` | `body` carries |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | the deal's terms |
| `task-authority/v0` | the sale's authority |
| `proposed-action/v0` | `action: "offer"`, `amount_minor`, `terms.price_minor` |
| `action-evaluation/v0` | the check's disposition and findings |
| `action-record/v0` | `action: "offer"`, `amount_minor` (the offer as made) |
| `action-approval/v0` | the buyer's acceptance (observed) |
| `proposed-action/v0` | `action: "commit"`, `amount_minor`, `terms.price_minor` |
| `action-evaluation/v0` | |
| `action-record/v0` | `action: "commit"`, `amount_minor` |
| `evidence` | `source: "x402_settle_response"` (payment received; `at` is its time) |
| `evidence` | `source: "seller_handoff"` (delivered; `at` is its time) |
| `action-outcome/v0` | `status: "received"` |
| `close` | |

The paid amount is in the buyer's terms leg and settlement legs, not in these exports; the
buyer's own store has `action-record/v0` with `action: "pay"` and `amount_minor`.

## Trade 7

The price change is sealed in the amounts. The seller's commit check pauses (`terms_changed`:
"Price changed since it was agreed ($1.50 to $1.75)"); the commit is attempted anyway, so there is
no `action-record/v0` commit. Instead:

```json
{"type": "action-outcome/v0", "body": {"status": "unchecked_action", "outcome": "mismatch",
  "attempted": {"action": "commit", "amount_minor": 175, "currency": "USD"},
  "findings": [{"rule": "changed_after_acceptance", "question": "asked"}]}}
```

So a "price as offered" fold is: the last offer's `amount_minor` equals the sealed commit's
`amount_minor`, and a deal with no `action-record/v0` commit (only the unchecked attempt) misses.
The buyer's half of trade 7 pays 175.

## Times

Sealed times are the replay's clock, so "paid before delivered" and "delivered within N days" are
met by every trade on the sealed `at` of the `x402_settle_response` and `seller_handoff` evidence.
The fixture carries no times.

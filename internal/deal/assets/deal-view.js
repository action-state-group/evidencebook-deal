// asked, what the agent did, anomalies on either side. Each item expands to its
// sealed steps.
//
// It is a module-slot script (agent-action-capsule's presentation contract):
// it registers its module with the page's runtime at load, and the runtime's
// resolver selects it for a verified deal bundle. It never verifies and never
// reads the bundle's records or disclosures itself: buildModel reads the
// verified context the runtime built, and what capsulectl checked when it
// built the page (the countersign line, and the words it recomputed against
// their sealed commitments), which the page's bootstrap sets as
// capsulectlDealPage before the page renders. render writes the model into the
// host. A step's line is shown only when its sealed record's disclosure
// verified, otherwise the step shows its capsule_id only. All text is set with
// textContent; nothing from the bundle is parsed as HTML.
//
// Its manifest is assets/deal-view.manifest.json; the copy below is the same
// manifest except executable.script_sha256, which a script cannot carry for
// itself (it is all zeros here). Its stylesheet is DEAL_VIEW_CSS, inserted
// once at render and pinned by the manifest's style_sha256 (assets/deal-view.css
// holds the same bytes).
// versionBefore reports whether version a is older than b: "v0.1.0-rc3" style,
// numbers compared as numbers, a pre-release before its release. An
// unparsable version, or a development build, is never called older.
